## Background

witsGWAS is a simple human GWAS analysis workflow built at the [Sydney Brenner Institute](http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/research/sbimb/20747/wits_bioinformatics.html) for data quality control (QC) and basic association testing. It takes away the need for having to enter individual commands at the unix prompt and rather organizes GWAS tasks sequentially (facilitated via [Ruffus](http://www.ruffus.org.uk/)) for submission to a distributed PBS Torque cluster (managed via [Rubra](https://github.com/bjpop/rubra)).

## Documentation 

Examples and tutorials for witsGWAS can be accessed at [witsGWAS_wiki](https://github.com/magosil86/witsGWAS/wiki)
